## Where to find internships & experiences

+ [Mustang Jobs](https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/explore-services/mustangjobs)
+ [Student Opportunity Blog](https://calpolystats.blogspot.com/)
+ [American Statistical Association JobWeb](https://www.amstat.org/your-career/asa-jobweb)
  + [Join the ASA](https://www.amstat.org/membership/become-a-member/membership-options?hkey=0301def8-92e1-4bf2-9aff-02959b3e61f5) for $25
+ [Mathematical Sciences REUs (Research Experience for Undergrads)](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5044)
+ Summer Institute in Biostatistics (SIBS) Programs
+ FROST Summer Research

## When to look for internships

+ I encourage you to start looking as early as October for the following summer. 
+ Many REU/SIBS deadlines are in January/February.
+ FROST applications happen at the end of Winter/early Spring Quarter.

Keep asking professors! Show them you are interested. If you bring them an idea, I am guessing most would be open to supervising.

## Reference Letter Writers

+ Ask professors you feel know you well (or previous employers). 
+ Give them at least 2 weeks heads up.
+ Provide them:
  + Resume
  + Link to job posting
  + Any additional relevant information
