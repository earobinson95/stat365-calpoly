# Journalistic Structure

## What is journalism?[^2]

[^2]: The Elements of Journalism, Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel

The "fourth estate" (the other three being "the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners)

1.  Journalism's first obligation is to the truth
2.  It's first loyalty is to citizens
3.  Its essence is a discipline of verification
4.  Its practitioners must maintain independence from those they cover
5.  It must serve as a monitor of power

## What is journalism?[^3]

[^3]: The Elements of Journalism, Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel

6.  It must provide a forum for public criticism and compromise
7.  It must strive to make the significant interesting and relevant
8.  It must present the news in a way that is comprehensive and proportional
9.  Its practitioners have an obligation to exercise their personal conscience
10. Citizens have rights and responsibilities when it comes to the news as well---even more so as they become producers and editors themselves

**There is no generally accepted conceptual definition of 'data journalism'** (Stalph, 2017). Most scholars have distinguished it by examining the distinct qualities of its process. For example, Anderson (2016, p. 2) calls it a "hybrid form of journalistic practice" that requires the fusion of "previously separate professional identities and empirical techniques such as quantitative analysis, social science methodology, and information visualization." Veglis and Bratsas (2017, p. 235) define it as **"the process of extracting useful information from data, writing articles based on the information, and embedding visualizations ... that help readers understand the significance of the story or allow them to pinpoint data that relate to them."** Howard (2014, p. 4) defines it as the **"application of data science to journalism, where data science is defined as the study of the extraction of knowledge from data,"** adding that the **"gathering, cleaning, organising, analysing, visualising, and publishing \[of\] data to support the creation of acts of journalism"** are central to its practice. Such scholars typically view data journalistic news

##

A smaller set of scholars have distinguished data journalism through **the form of its content.** For example, Knight (2015, p. 59) defines it as “**a story whose primary source or ‘peg’ is numeric** (rather than anecdotal), or a story which contains a substantial element of data or visualisation.” Lee and colleagues (2015, p. 85) define a ‘visual data story’ as one that includes “a set of … specific facts backed up by data” that “are visualized to support one or more intended messages” and “presented in a meaningful order.” Regardless of whether data journalism is conceptualized through form or process, two elements stand out: **(1) quantitative information should play a central role in the development or telling of the story; and (2) there should be some visual representation of the data referenced in the story.** These elements are not self-evident, however, and are difficult to operationalize. For example, how might one quantify the extent to which data influenced the generation of a story described primarily through anecdotes?
