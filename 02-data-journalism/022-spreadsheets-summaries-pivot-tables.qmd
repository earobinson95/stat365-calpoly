An article that appeared in the journal Lancet in May of 2021 (Datoo, et al.) described a study that **investigated a potential vaccine that might protect children against malaria**. Researchers
recruited children between the ages of 5 and 17 months in Burkina Faso, a country in western Africa, as participants. The **children were randomly assigned into one of three groups: one group received a large dose of the potential vaccine, another group received a small dose, and a third group received a placebo.** Researchers observed the children for the next 18 months, keeping track of **whether or not the child developed malaria.** Researchers hoped, of course, that children who received a vaccine would be less likely to develop malaria than children who received a placebo.

## Excel Operations

+ Freeze panes,
+ Filter and sort observations,
+ Pivot tables, and
+ Summaries, etc.

If you think you can do it, Google it!

Excel has a programming language called VBA (Visual Basic Analysis) -- most people write macros in this.

## Persnickety Percentages

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 65%
knitr::include_graphics("images/pivot-table-counts.jpg")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 65%
knitr::include_graphics("images/pivot-table-proportions.jpg")
```

## Interpretting Proportions

::: panel-tabset
### Diff in prop

The **difference in success proportions** between two groups, multiplied by 100, should be expressed as a difference in percentage points.

$$p_{success|A} – p_{success|B}$$

### Percentage Diff
The **percentage difference** in success proportions between two groups, with group B as the baseline, is calculated as: 
$$\frac{(p_{success|A} – p_{success|B})}{p_{success|B}} × 100%.$$

or equivalently: $\text{percentage difference} = (\text{relative risk} - 1) \times 100$

### Relative Risk

The **relative risk** between two groups is the ratio of their success proportions.

$$\frac{p_{success|A}}{p_{success|B}}$$

### Odds Ratio

The **odds of success** are calculated as: 
$$\frac{\text{# of successes}}{\text{# of failures}}.$$

The **odds against** an event are calculated as
 $$\frac{\text{# of failures}}{\text{# of successes}}.$$

Odds ratio is *invariant* to which outcome is labeled a "success".
