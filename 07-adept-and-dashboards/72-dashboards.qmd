## What is a Dashboard?

+ Visual display of information (combination of text and graphics)
+ Display information to achieve a specific objective
+ Might include interactivity (e.g. dynamic)

. . .

**Variations in dashboard uses**

+ Role of the dashboard: strategic, analytical, operational
+ Type of data included in the dashboard
+ Update frequency
+ Interactivity

# Types of interaction^[via Amelia McNamara]

<!-- + **Select:** mark something as interesting -->
<!-- + **Explore:** show me something else -->
<!-- + **Reconfigure:** show me a different arrangement -->
<!-- + **Encode:** show me a different representation -->
<!-- + **Abstract/Elaborate:** show me more or less detail -->
<!-- + **Filter:** show me something conditionally -->
<!-- + **Connect:** show me related items -->

## Dashboard Design (Best Practices)

+ Know your purpose and audience - Ask yourself, what are you trying to say with this Dashboard? Who are you saying this information to?
+ Take advantage of most viewed spots - You should start with your most important content in the top left. This is where most people start viewing a visualization.
+ Limit the number of views - In general, you should limit the number of views to two or three.
+ Show filters - Use of filters help specify which data is shown in the view.
+ Use highlighting - When turned on, a selection in one view can show relevant fields in other views. 


# [RShiny](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/)

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("shiny")
```

# [Tableau Dashboards](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/dashboard-showcase)

Dashboards are a collection of worksheets and information shown in a single view. Worksheets and dashboards are connected.

## Tableau: Dashboard Layout

:::: columns
::: column
+ On the Dashboard, several options are available on the left side menu.
+ The Dashboard pane allows you to toggle the different views available. Possible options include Default, Desktop, Tablet, and Phone.
+ The Size section allows you to change the default size of the dashboard.
+ The Sheets sections provides a list of available views that can be added to the dashboard.

## Tableau: Dashboard Layout

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=60%}
Objects allow you to add visual appeal and interactivity to your dashboard.

::: {style="font-size: 24px;"}
+ *Horizontal and Vertical* - Containers that let you group related objects.
+ *Text* - Creates headers and explanations.
+ *Image* - Add visual graphics to the dashboard.
+ *Web Page* -
+ *Blank* - Help you adjust spacing between dashboard items.
+ *Navigation* - Lets your audience navigate from one object to another.
+ *Download* - Lets your audience download a PDF, PowerPoint, or PNG of entire dashboard.

## Tableau: Dashboard Tips

Using the sheet drop down menu, you can add a Show/Hide button. This provides the option to toggle the sheet off and on.

If you edit a view on a worksheet, it will update on any dashboard using that view. This is the same for any view updated on a dashboard.

Sheets can be added to a dashboard by dragging them from the Dashboard pane over to the dashboard Canvas. 

You can swap a sheet using this area. You first must click on the sheet on the dashboard.

## Tableau: Dasbhoard Actions

[Interactivity](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_create.htm#add-interactivity) can be added to a dashboard to enhance your audience experience. 

Using the dropdown menu on a sheet on the dashboard, you can add filters and highlighters. Along with interactivity, actions can be added to your dashboard.

Under the Dashboards menu, click Actions to set up a new Dashboard action.

+ Highlight Action - Use this action to call attention to marks of interest by coloring relevant marks and shading others.
+ Filter Actions - Use this action to send information between worksheets.
+ URL Actions - Uses a hyperlink that points to a webpage, file, or other web-base outside Tableau. Checking the box “single-select only” prevents navigation to a sheet after clicking it once. 

## Tableau: Publishing a Dashboard

Tableau provides the option to share your data sources (live or extract), dashboards, stories, and sheets with people using Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud. 

When publishing to a server you have the options to

+ Add tags
+ Select which worksheets are published
+ Set permissions 
+ Embed data sources 

Once published, the workbook can be viewed using a web browser or the Tableau mobile app. Along with publishing a dashboard, workbooks can be exported as a PDF file option on the navigation bar.
