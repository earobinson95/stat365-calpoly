## Data Viz Narratives: Feedback & Revision Process

+ When working with a quantitative response -- show variability! Raw data points, box plots, density plots, histograms, error bars, etc.
  
+ Accessibility -- color choices, double encode, `#| fig-alt: "alt text here."`

+ Put the key take-away in the title!
  + e.g., Instead of "How does childcare cost differ between infants and toddlers", state "Childcare costs for infants is breaking the bank!"
  
*Pay attention to the details! I am fairly picky about table and plot design, keep this in mind for your final report.*

# REUs (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) + SIBS (Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Data Science)

## What is an REU?

+ A summer research program for undergraduate students funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

  + Each student is typically assigned to a research group and works closely with faculty and other students.
+ Students receive stipends and (often) assistance with housing and travel.
+ REUs typically last about 8-12 weeks during the summer.
  + In addition to research, REUs typically include fun activities.

## What is SIBS?

+ A summer research program for undergraduate students funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
