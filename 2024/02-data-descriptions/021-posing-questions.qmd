## Observational Units and Variables

For each of the following questions, identify the relevant observational units and variables.

::: callout-note
Also classify each variable as numerical or categorical (also binary?). For studies with more than one variable, also identify the explanatory and response variables.
:::

-   What is the average amount of a transaction at the Subway restaurant on campus?
-   Are Reese's Pieces candies equally likely to be orange, brown, or yellow?
-   Can the price at which a grandfather clock sells at auction be predicted from its age, number of bidders, and country of manufacture?

## Scope of Inference

### Experiment vs Observation

```{r}

#| out-width: 70%
#| echo: false

```

### Generalization to a Population

## Words with Friends

My friend Jeff likes to play Words with Friends against his computer.  He keeps track of many variables for each game that he plays, and he records the results in a spreadsheet.  The following image shows the first ten rows (from a total of 1,306 rows) in his spreadsheet:

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/words-with-friends.png")
```

## Words with Friends

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/words-with-friends.png")
```

1. What are the observational units?  Do these appear in rows or columns of the data set?  How many observational units are in the spreadsheet?

2. How many variables are shown here?  Do these appear in rows or columns of the spreadsheet?  How many are categorical, and how many are numerical?

## Words with Friends

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/words-with-friends.png")
```

3. Pose some statistical questions that could be investigated with these data, involving:

:::: columns
::: column
+ one categorical variable
+ one numerical variable
+ two categorical variables
:::
::: column
+ one categorical and one numerical variable
+ two numerical variables
:::

```{r}

```

4. Pose a statistical question about these data for which comparative boxplots would be an appropriate graph. 

## Words with Friends

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/words-with-friends.png")
```

5. Pose a statistical question about these data for which calculating multiple proportions would be appropriate.

## Words with Friends

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/words-with-friends.png")
```

6. Pose a statistical question about these data for which one-way ANOVA would be appropriate but a two-sample t-test would not be appropriate.

## Reproduciblility!

Reproducibility in scientific research is important in order for other researchers to be able to replicate your study results. This includes:

-   A detailed Research Protocol
-   Organized and clear documentation of the study
    -   Data storage
    -   Analyses
    -   Results
    -   Documents

## To do

`r fontawesome::fa("comments")` **Data Proposal**

+ Begin Brainstorming data sets + questions!
+ Due Thursday 4/11 at 11:59pm
