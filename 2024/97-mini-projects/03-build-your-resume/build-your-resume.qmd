For this assignment, we'll be crafting our resumes to a professional state.

## Overleaf Template & Appearance

As part of this mini-project, you will be working with Overleaf, a $\LaTeX$ editor. Visit <https://www.overleaf.com/register> to register for a FREE account -- make sure you remember the email and password you use! You will likley come back to this next fall when applying for internships.

Overleaf provides resume templates; visit <https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv> to select a template. Keep in mind, the template should be simple and organized (there are some bad resume templates on there!). Here are a few of my favorites (you can also make modifications):

-   <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/russelresume/zqnypvvjsfvq>
-   <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/rezume/kfrvqywfkwjs>
-   <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/resume-one-page/hsrxmjssndwc>

While some look snazzy like [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/altacv-nicolasomar-fork/htfpmrwhbwpw) and [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/extensive-adjustable-curriculum-vitae-cv/kncgcpxcqykb), they are actually difficult to follow.

Overleaf uses $\LaTeX$ formatting, which means there are special symbols used to style your document such as indentations, lists, section headers, horizontal lines, etc. Below are some resources to give you guidance:

-   [Paragraphs and new lines](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Paragraphs_and_new_lines)
-   [Bold, italics and underlining](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bold%2C_italics_and_underlining)
-   [Lists](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Lists)

In particular, $\LaTeX$ is especially good at formatting [math expressions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions); however, your resume likely does not include any so that is not a concern. Another great resource for math expressions in $\LaTeX$ is [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html).

## Sections to include {#sections}

There is some flexibility in making your resume reflect your personal experience. However, I have outlined the sections I would like to see in your resume along with guidelines about how to describe your experiences. See [Cal Poly Career Services Resume Review Checklist](https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/careerservices/1/webform/Resume%20Review%20Checklist%20FINAL%20FALL%202019.pdf) for additional guidance.

Career services provides additional resources for assisting in crafting your resume:

-   [Cal Poly Career Services](https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/)
    -   [Drop-in resume review](https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/explore-services/career-counseling)
    -   [Events](https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/explore-services/your-events)
-   [Resume Guide & Examples](https://content-calpoly-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/careerservices/1/images/new_exploreservices/new_resourcetoolkit/Resume%20Guide.pdf)
-   [Additional tips](https://careerservices.calpoly.edu/explore-services/resource-toolkit/resumes-letters)

### Examples

See two examples or resumes I have helped edit:

-   [Mark Robinson](https://earobinson95.github.io/stat365-calpoly/2024/97-mini-projects/build-your-resume/Example-Resume-1.pdf)
-   [Kory Heier](https://earobinson95.github.io/stat365-calpoly/2024/97-mini-projects/build-your-resume/Example-Resume-2.pdf)

You do not have to take these verbatim as some aspects might not quite align with career services recommendations, but I think they are both decent examples.

See the statistics example from Career services:

::: callout-tip
### Formatting Bullet Points

-   Begin with strong action verbs
-   Quantify results when possible ("increased sales by 10%")
-   Focus on what you accomplished or contributed, not on day-to-day details of job
-   No complete sentences, no periods
:::

### Header

Your header is a snapshot of you; should stand out as the first thing recruiters and employers see.

-   Name
-   Address (optional) -- maybe just City, State
-   Phone number
-   E-mail address (try making this a hyperlink)
-   LinkedIn/GitHub/Personal Website URL(s) (optional)

### Education (and Relevant Coursework)

-   California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) -- if you plan to reference later
-   Degree type (e.g. Bachelor of Science in Statistics)
-   Expected graduation month/year
-   Concentration/Minors (if applicable)
-   GPA or Major GPA (if above 3.0)
-   Any relevant courswork (may decide to include in its own section)
-   Community college if you earned a degree (if applicable)
-   Study abroad
-   Don't include high school education information.

### Work Experience

-   Include in each entry:
    -   Employer name
    -   Employer location - city and state only
    -   Position title
    -   Employment start/end date
    -   1-4ish bullet points describing your experience (Action Verb + What You Did + Why It Matters)

::: callout-note
I don't see why you can't write your bullet points and then have ChatGPT help you refine them, but make sure you read them back and modify as necessary rather than just taking them at face value!
:::

-   List experiences in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
-   May include work experience, summer jobs, internships, and maybe volunteer work.
-   Only include high school experience if highly relevant.
-   If you have different categories of experience, categorize by theme (i.e., Work Experience, Volunteer Experience, Relevant/Statistical Experience).

### Projects/Research

Include 1-3 projects. These can include class projects, personal projects, undergraduate research (if not included in work experience), specific leadership in co-curricular activities (might put these in the involvement and leadership).

Include in each entry:

-   Name of project
-   Link to project and/or code if on GitHub (optional)
-   Date of project
-   Supervisor (if relevant; does not need to be listed for class projects)
-   Software/tools used to complete the project
-   2-3 bullet points describing the project (Action Verb + What You Did + Why It Matters)

### Skills

-   Technical (R, SAS, Excel, Tableau, SQL any specific certifications, etc.)
-   Statistical (Data Visualization, Supervised Learning, Experimental Design, etc.)
-   Foreign language

You should demonstrate your soft skills through your experience bullet points.

### Optional Sections (if relevant)

The following sections may apply to your personal experiences. Follow good formatting and bullet-point crafting for each entry (Name, Location, Date, bullet-points).

-   Honors and Awards (list is okay, include measurable amounts for things like scholarships, etc.)
-   Involvement and Leadership (Encouraged)
-   Community Service
-   Interests

## Final Submission Rubric

To meet the "satisfactory" requirements for the contract, this project must:

-   be turned in on time (or within the agreed upon time by 24 hour late tokens submitted **prior** to the due date),

-   include all components described above

-   Meet quality guidelines laid out in the following rubric (all 2s and above for each element and demonstration of additional considerations)
