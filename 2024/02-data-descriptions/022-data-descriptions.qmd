## Wednesday, April 10th

-   Use active voice!
-   Describe your data
-   Align statistical analysis methods
-   Work on data proposals

## `r fontawesome::fa("spell-check")` (by zombies) test for `r fontawesome::fa("ban")` passive voice!

::: callout-caution
Your final report should be written in first person active voice.

## Describing your Data

### When, Where, How, Who, What (The Ws!)

### Consider the [Childcare Data Set](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md)...

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
childcare_costs <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/childcare_costs.csv')
counties <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/counties.csv')
```

```{r}
# code to create ca_childcare
ca_childcare <- counties |> 
  filter(state_abbreviation == "CA") |> 
  left_join(childcare_costs,
            by = "county_fips_code"
            )

ca_childcare |> 
  select(county_name, state_abbreviation, study_year, funr_20to64, fme_2018, mcsa:mfcc_preschool) |> 
  head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Describing Variables

-   Use context!
-   Don't forget units of measurement
    -   Rates have units!
-   Usually provide summary statistics
    -   Pay attention to significant digits
    -   Don't forget sample sizes

## Statistical analysis methods {style="text-align: center;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 60%

```

## Things to consider when explaining your statistical analysis methods

**How** the data were analysed (including the software used, and the statistical methods used).

-   Statistical analysis used and any specifications.
-   Include the software and version used to analyze the data. Make sure to include any packages and their versions!
-   Define your significance level.
-   Address any posthoc tests or adjustments for multiple comparisons.

*For each question you pose, give a quick blurb about the appropriate analysis. Keep it simple; remember the goal is communication, not fancy stats!*
