# Design Principles

## Principle 1: expressiveness^[via Jordan Crouser]

Encode all the facts.

Encode only the facts.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
knitr::include_graphics("images/expressiveness.jpg")
```

## Principle 2: consistency^[via Jordan Crouser]

Use consistent axes when comparing charts.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
knitr::include_graphics("images/consistency-1.jpg")
```

## Principle 2: consistency^[via Jordan Crouser]

A note on legends: order items according to appearance.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
knitr::include_graphics("images/consistency-2.jpg")
```

## Principle 2: consistency^[via Jordan Crouser]

Visual variation should reflect and enhance the underlying variation in the data.

Avoid visually similar encodings for independent variables.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
knitr::include_graphics("images/consistency-3.jpg")
```

## Principle 3: importance ordering^[Heer J, Bostock M (2010) Crowdsourcing graphical perception: using mechanical turk to assess visualization design. Proceedings of the 28th international conference on Human factors in computing systems.]

Avoid unnecessary containment and repetition.

Navigational aids shouldn’t compete with data.

Avoid: heavy axes, error bars.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/importance-ordering-1.jpg")
```

## Principle 3: importance ordering^[<https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/the-unspoken-rules-of-visualisation-and-when-to-break-them>]

- use a reasonable number of slices, aggregating minor categories if necessary
- order the slices by size from the largest to the smallest
- place the ’Other’ slice at the end of the sequence, regardless of the order scheme
- position the first and largest slice against the upper vertical radius, and arrange the other slices in a clockwise fashion
- vary colors only if the colors are encoding data.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
knitr::include_graphics("images/importance-ordering-2.jpg")
```

## Principle 3: importance ordering^[via Jordan Crouser]

Simplify, simplify, simplify!

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
knitr::include_graphics("images/importance-ordering-3.jpg")
```

## Tufte and the data-ink ratio

data-ink ratio = data ink / total ink used to print the graphic

= proportion of a graphic’s ink devoted to the
non-redundant display of data-information

= 1 - proportion of a graphic that can be erased

## `r fontawesome::fa("brain")` Bad Graphics Day!

Apply what we know about graphical perception to the visualizations.

(Can complete in pairs)

1. Visit <http://viz.wtf/> and pick your favorite "bad graphic".
2. Upload a copy to the [Google slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SJrci-UHCZL8pqSpTOLIsH30MGLUcUefsqmTJpsf4w0/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Add a short description or bullet point list of how the graph violates perceptual and design principles.
4. Both of you should copy the URL for your slide and upload it to the Canvas assignment.

<!-- What's wrong with this picture? -->

<!-- Let’s critique some visualizations using these principles -->
<!-- Try to think about the following questions: -->
<!-- • What is the first thing you notice about the visualization? -->
<!-- • What is the point the visualization is trying to make? -->
<!-- • Who is the intended audience? -->
<!-- • What is the visualization doing well? -->
<!-- • What problems do you see with the visualization design? -->
<!-- • Why do you think the designer made those choices? -->

## `r fontawesome::fa("brain")` Question to ponder: should visualizations be immediately readable, or should you need to study them?

# [Copy the Masters](https://earobinson95.github.io/stat365-calpoly/97-mini-projects/copy-the-masters/copy-the-masters.html)
