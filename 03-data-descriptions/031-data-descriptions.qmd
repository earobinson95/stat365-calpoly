# Describing your Data
## When, Where, How, Who, What (The Ws!)

+ How the sample was obtained.
+ How the data were collected (the data collection protocol).
+ How the data were analysed (including the software used, and the statistical methods used).
+ What specialized equipment was used (don't list pencils, rulers, paper, etc.!).

## Remember our Mandela Data?

## Your turn!

A study ([Brunton et al. 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/3/2/41)) recorded the response of kangaroos to drones (one of 'Vigilance', 'No vigilance', 'Flee 
<10 m', or 'Flee >10 m') and the altitude of the drone (30m, 60m, 100m or 120m). The mob size and sex of the kangaroo was also recorded. Describe the variables in the study.

## How might we analyze the Mendela Data?
