-   Gestalt Principles
-   Perception of Data Viz
-   Case Study
-   Redesign the Graph

## The gestalt effect

-   *gestalt* = form or pattern

-   **Gestalt philosophy:** "The whole is other than the sum parts" -Kurt Koffka

-   **Gestalt principals:** Predictable ways by which we organize sensory information.

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 80%
knitr::include_graphics("images/gestalt.jpg")
```

## Law of proximity

We interpret objects that are close to each other as a group

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 80%
knitr::include_graphics("images/law-of-proximity.png")
```

## Law of similarity

We interpret objects that are visually similar to each other as a group

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/law-of-similarity.png")
```

## Law of closure

When parts of a picture are missing, we fill in the visual gap

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 80%
knitr::include_graphics("images/law-of-closure.png")
```

## Law of symmetry

We perceive objects as being symmetrical, arranged around a center point

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 50%
knitr::include_graphics("images/law-of-symmetry.jpg")
```

## Law of common fate

We group objects that we percieve to be moving along the same path

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 60%
knitr::include_graphics("images/law-of-common-fate.png")
```

## Law of continuity

We tend to group objects along the smoothest path

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 80%
knitr::include_graphics("images/law-of-continuity.jpg")
```

# Perception

## Some things are processed slower[^3]

```{r}

## Fast = "pre-attentive processing"

-   Things that happen in \<200ms of visual stimulation
-   Performed in parallel across the entire visual field

## "An understanding of what is processed pre-attentively is probably the most important contribution that visual science can make to the data visualization" (Ware, 2004, p. 19)

## Pre-attentive processing facilitates:

-   Target detection (Presence or absence)
-   Boundary detection / grouping
-   Region tracking
-   Counting and estimation

# Graphical Perception

## Cleveland and McGill, 1984

:::: columns
::: column
The following are the 10 elementary tasks in Figure 1, ordered from most to least accurate:

1.  Position along a common scale
2.  Positions along nonaligned scales
3.  Length, direction, angle
4.  Area
5.  Volume, curvature
6.  Shading, color saturation

## Implications for Practice

1.  Know how we perceive groups

2.  Know that we perceive some groups before others

3.  Design to facilitate and emphasize the **most important comparisons**
