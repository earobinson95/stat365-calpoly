# Course description

This two-unit course is designed to help students develop strong written
communication skills in statistics and data analysis. Through guided practice
and feedback, students will learn to effectively communicate statistical ideas
and results to different audiences using appropriate graphs and tables. The
course will cover strategies for discerning relevant and necessary information
and for selecting and describing appropriate methods to analyze data, building
on students' previous statistics coursework.

**Prerequisites:** Completion of GE Area A2, completion of GE Area A3, and a
second course in Statistical Methods (STAT 252, STAT 302, or STAT 313).

**Requirements:** This course is required for Statistics majors but does not
count toward the Statistics minor or any other degree program.

## Course goals

By the end of this course, you will:

-   Enhance your written communication skills in statistics and data analysis,
    specifically through the use of appropriate graphs and tables to convey
    statistical ideas and results.
-   Synthesize output from statistical software to address research questions
    and analyze data with lexical precision and accuracy.
-   Evaluate the statistical background of your intended audience, and adapt the
    style and content of your written reports to suit their needs and context.
-   Demonstrate your understanding of statistical concepts such as parameters
    versus statistics, variability, p-values, margin-of-error, interaction, and
    scope of conclusions.
-   Develop proficiency in writing and producing technical reports with adequate
    documentation to ensure reproducibility.
-   Learn how to use spreadsheets, Tableau, and R for data visualization and
    communication.
-   Gain experience in integrating statistical analysis, data visualization, and
    technical writing in a reproducible manner.

# Textbooks

I have reserved eBooks for most of the textbooks and readings through the Cal
Poly Library [course reserves](https://reserves.calstate.edu/slo/).

The main textbooks used in this course are:

-   Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science (Deborah Nolan
    and Sara Stoudt)
-   Storytelling with Data (Cole Knaflic)

In addition to the textbooks, there will be a number of readings provided from
other texts, including:

-   Numbers in the Newsroom (Sarah Cohen)
-   The Functional Art (Alberto Cairo)
-   Visualize This (Nathan Yau)
-   How to Lie with Statistics (Darrell Huff)
-   Show Me the Numbers (Stephen Few)
-   The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (Edward Tufte)
-   Better Data Visualizations (Jonathan Schwabish)

and more.

# Grading

In this class we will be using a contract grading system. This is designed to
give flexibility and freedom to explore while ensuring a level of
accountability. Learning to write takes practice. I do not want worries about
grades to distract us from being creative, taking risks, and ultimately finding
our voices.

You are guaranteed a grade of a B for this class if you meet the following
conditions:

-   Submit assignments (readings, writing prompts, class activities, peer
    reviews, and final report check-points) on time and meet the "satisfactory"
    criteria with a maximum of 3 missed assignments.
-   Complete all mini-projects on time and meet the "satisfactory" conditions on
    the rubrics.
-   Submit the final technical report on time and meet the "satisfactory"
    conditions on the rubric.

Your grade will decrease by a third of a step (for example a B to a B-) for each
B condition that you do not meet. Missing assignments will be scaled, so that if
for example you miss six assignments, turn in two mini-projects late, or turn in
your final technical report late your grade will decrease by two thirds of a
step (for example a B to a C+).

A missing final technical report submission will result in a maximum grade of a
D+ at the instructor's discretion.

You can increase your letter grade by *up to* a third of a step (for example a B
to B+) for meeting each of the following conditions (further instructions will
be provided):

-   Complete a weekly submission to the [NYT: What's going on in this
    graph](https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph), missing
    no more than three weeks throughout the quarter.
-   Listen to the [99% Invisible podcast on Florence Nightingale: Data Viz
    Pioneer](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/florence-nightingale-data-viz-pioneer/).
    Find the data set to recreate the rose diagram, compare with a stacked bar
    plot, discuss the story, and argue why Florence needed the rose diagram.
-   Select a data set from
    [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or [Makeover
    Monday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/) and use guiding principles
    to create an effective dashboard using Tableau or RShiny to highlight key
    points.
-   Participate in [The Stats+Stories 300th Episode Data Visualization
    Contest](https://statsandstories.net/contest).
-   [Make your own
    website](https://earobinson95.github.io/stat365-calpoly/98-grade-boosters/make-your-own-website.html)
    using Quarto and GitHub to showcase your statistical projects.
-   Complete a technical report project that goes above and beyond the
    requirements. Your job is to convince me in an additional one page document
    why you think your contribution goes the extra mile.
-   I encourage you to suggest your own "boosting" condition via the suggestion
    "box" form on Canvas.

For example, to earn an A in this class you must meet the conditions for a B and
complete three of the "boosting" conditions above to "satisfactory" quality.

Any deviation from the grading policies outlined above will only be to your
benefit.

## Grade Breakdown

1.  **Readings and participation:**

You will be expected to complete assigned readings before coming to class and
participate in class discussions and activities. Your peer review participation
and engagement in class will be evaluated throughout the quarter.
<!-- Additionally, you will be required to take readiness quizzes to assess your understanding of the material. -->

2.  **Writing prompts and activities:**

Throughout the course, you will be given writing prompts and activities to help
you develop your technical writing skills. These will include assignments such
as summarizing statistical findings, interpreting graphs and tables, and writing
up executive memos. These assignments will be designed to help you practice
communicating complex statistical concepts and analyses clearly and effectively.

3.  **Mini-projects:**

There will be three mini-projects throughout the quarter, each designed to help
you develop and apply your statistical communication skills. The mini-projects
will include:

-   *One Number Story:* In this assignment, you will choose a single number that
    summarizes a key finding from the provided data set and craft a compelling
    story around it, using appropriate statistical evidence to support your
    claims.

-   *Copy the Masters:* For this assignment, you will reproduce graphics from
    FiveThirtyEight. You will use good data visualization principles and
    practicies.

-   *Build your resume:* In this assignment, you will create a resume using
    Overleaf to highlight your education, statistical communication and
    technical skills, statistics and data science projects, and other relevant
    experiences.

Detailed rubrics will be provided for each mini-project to help guide your work
and ensure that you meet the required standards.

4.  **Technical report project:**

The [technical report
project](https://earobinson95.github.io/stat365-calpoly/99-final-project/final-project-instructions.html)
is the culminating assignment of the course, where you will have the opportunity
to apply all the skills and knowledge you have acquired throughout the quarter.
This will be completed individually. You will be required to choose a research
question, collect and analyze data using appropriate statistical methods, and
produce a technical report that effectively communicates your findings. You will
be provided with guidelines and resources to support your work, and you will
receive feedback and guidance throughout the project. The technical report
project will be evaluated based on its clarity, thoroughness, and adherence to
standard statistical practices.

## Late work

I understand that unexpected events may arise during the quarter that may
prevent you from submitting your assignments on time. To accommodate for this,
you will be given four 24-hour late submission "tokens" to use throughout the
quarter. To use a token, you must (1) send me an email and (2) fill out the
deadline extension form [here](https://forms.gle/3uVhdWCN4DN373XE7). The
extension request must be submitted **before** the assignment due date.

These tokens **cannot** be used on your final technical report submission.

Your remaining tokens will be tracked in a Canvas assignment as four points,
with each token worth one point.

# Course Expectations

You will get out of this course what you put in. The following excerpt was taken
from Rob Jenkins' article "Defining the Relationship" which was published in The
Chronicle of Higher Education (August 8, 2016). This accurately summarizes what
I expect of you in my classroom (and also what you should expect of me).

*"I'd like to be your partner. More than anything, I'd like for us to form a
mutually beneficial alliance in this endeavor we call education.*

*I pledge to do my part. I will:*

-   *Stay abreast of the latest ideas in my field.*
-   *Teach you what I believe you need to know; with all the enthusiasm I
    possess.*
-   *Invite your comments and questions and respond constructively.*
-   *Make myself available to you outside of class (within reason).*
-   *Evaluate your work carefully and return it promptly with feedback.*
-   *Be as fair, respectful, and understanding as I can humanly be.*
-   *If you need help beyond the scope of this course, I will do my best to
    provide it or see that you get it.*

*In return, I expect you to:*

-   *Show up for class each day or let me know (preferably in advance) if you
    have some good reason to be absent.*
-   *Do your reading and other assignments outside of class and be prepared for
    each class meeting.*
-   *Focus during class on the work we're doing and not on extraneous matters
    (like whoever or whatever is on your phone at the moment).*
-   *Participate in class discussions.*
-   *Be respectful of your fellow students and their points of view.*
-   *In short, I expect you to devote as much effort to learning as I devote to
    teaching.*

*What you get out of this relationship is that you'll be better equipped to
succeed in this and other college courses, work-related assignments, and life in
general. What I get is a great deal of professional and personal satisfaction.
Because I do really like you \[all\] and want the best for you."*

# Learning Environment and Support

I am committed to creating a safe and inclusive learning environment where all
students feel respected and supported. If there are any ways I can improve the
classroom environment to make it more welcoming for you, please don't hesitate
to let me know.

If you have a disability and require accommodations to fully participate in the
course, please contact me as soon as possible to discuss how I can best support
you. I also encourage you to register with Cal Poly's Disability Resource Center
(Building 124, Room 119 or at 805-756-1395) to explore additional accommodations
that may be available to you.

If you are experiencing food insecurity, housing instability, or other
challenges that may impact your ability to succeed in this course, please refer
to the resources listed on Canvas under "Student Support Services at Cal Poly."
These resources provide a range of essential support services, including
emergency financial assistance, counseling, and academic support.

I am committed to working with you to ensure that you have the resources and
support you need to succeed in this course. Let's work together to create a
positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.

# Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is a fundamental value of this course and of the university.
Simply put, I will not tolerate cheating, plagiarism, or any other form of
academic dishonesty.

Any incident of academic misconduct, including dishonesty, copying, or
plagiarism, will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and
Responsibilities.

Cheating or plagiarism will result in an incomplete grade for the assignment and
an overall grade deduction of one-third (e.g., B to a B-). In cases of flagrant
cheating, a grade of F for the course may be assigned.

It is important to note that paraphrasing or quoting another's work without
proper citation is a form of academic misconduct. This includes using Chat GPT,
which should only be used to generate ideas and not as a substitute for your own
work.

To ensure academic integrity, please be sure to cite all sources appropriately
and only use Chat GPT in an ethical manner. For more information on academic
misconduct and what constitutes cheating and plagiarism, please see
[academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating](https://academicprograms.calpoly.edu/content/academicpolicies/Cheating).
