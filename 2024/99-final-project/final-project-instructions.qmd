::: callout-note
You can choose to use whichever document editors (Word, Google Docs, Quarto) and statistical software programs (R, SAS, Python, JMP, Minitab) you are most comfortable using as long as they can appropriately carry out your analysis. However, you must submit all documents as .pdf file extensions so I can provide written feedback within Canvas via my iPad.

If you have the background and skills, I do encourage you to use a scripting language (R, SAS, Python), and good graphing tools (ggplot2, Tableau, Datawrapper). I will expect more than the default graphics produced by JMP.

## Collaboration Tools

Part of this experience will be learning to communicate and write with others. You may find the following tools useful for setting up your collaboration.

+ GitHub
+ Posit Cloud -- *I think if you get a student subscription for $5/month I can add you to my instructor workspace and you may have collaborative editting privlages (like Google docs for R!). We will need to test this out though*
+ Google Docs
+ OneDrive

# Reproducibe Workflow {.unnumbered}

As a part of this project, you will demonstrate reproducible workflows and research. Following the guidelines in [Third Time's a Charm: A Tripartite Approach for Teaching Project Organization to Students](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/26939169.2022.2118644?needAccess=true&role=button), your root project folder should include:

-   `README.txt` file to orient someone to the electronic files or for processes that will be repeated throughout a study (e.g., specific data cleaning rules and scoring algorithm at multiple time points). Ideally the root project folder will be stored on a secure server and/or cloud location (such as Git repository or OneDrive) that meets all project regulatory needs with access limited to approved team members while allowing for version control.

and the following sub-folders

-   `data` stores all data sets associated with the project (including original, analytic data sets, format files, etc.). The data folder should have a sub-folder where an original, raw, uneditable version of the data is archived and used for import into statistical software (similar to data and data_raw approach in R packages, Wickham, Bryan, and Barrett2022). Projects with many different data sources can have a separate sub-folder for each source

-   `documents` stores all of the written documents for the project. There may be sub-folders for references (statistical and/or domain), article or conference submissions, primary literature/scoring manuals for psychometric scales and other constructs, etc. Importantly, you must document decisions and revised analytic plans during the course of the project.

-   `results` stores all output from the scripts and any derived tables and figures. Spreadsheets, Word tables, RTF files, plots, figures, PDFs of output, all are stored in this folder. If statistical scripts directly produced it or it was created from results derived from statistical scripts, the files should go in this folder.

-   `scripts` stores all statistical programs/syntax/scripts/code (called "scripts" hereafter) used for the project (and statistical scripts should be used as much as possible when handling data!). Much of the documentation of our work is included in statistical scripts tailored to each individual project. Script file names should explicitly describe what step in the research process the script is for and what the script is intended to do, from reading in the original data to creating the analytic data set to summary statistics to multi-variable modeling. RMarkdownfiles / Quarto files (except for your technical report document(s) if using this document editor for your formal writing) should be stored here as well (Baumeret al 2014; Dvoraketal 2019; Allaireetal 2022).

-   Always use good programming practice, which includes: informative script headers, readable code, use of comments,and creation of separate scripts for distinct parts of the project. See CwD ch. 8 about documenting your code.

-   If you are using a non-scripted language (JMP, Minitab, etc.) please make sure to include a document which describes the steps you took in analyzing the data.

In your final submission, you will turn in a `.zip` file of your project folder in order for me to evaluate your organization and workflow.

## CP 1: Data Proposal {#data-proposal -}

You will be working in groups of three to four to produce a technical written report investigating and telling a story about a data set selected from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository. Throughout the course, you will work with this data set to complete individual mini-projects (One Number Story and Data Narrative Visualization) before coming together to storyboard and write your final group report.

::: callout-warning
I will be using the [Childcare Costs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md) data set as an example throughout the quarter. Therefore, you may not select this data set.
:::

For the first group project check point:

1. Select a **data set** from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository that interests all group members.
  + Include the link to the data repo.
  + Save this data for you to use throughout the quarter.
2. Include a well-written **data description** (recall the 5 Ws!)
  + Where did the data come from (not just TidyTuesday)?
    + When were the data collected?
    + Where were the data collected?
    + How were the data collected?
  + Who/What are the observations/subjects in the data?
  + What information was measured/collected on the observations in the data set?
    + Don't just list these out, make it flow.
3. Include a list of 3 **research questions** you could investigate with your data set along with proposed statistical methods. 
  + Be clear by indicating the variables you would use.
4. Answer the following questions as part of your **group contract.**
  + How will you communicate? Email? Text? Discord? Meet in person or via Zoom?
  + How often will you be expected to check for updates from your group members?
  + Will there be a group leader, or will this task be rotated in some way? How will you ensure that all project deadlines are met?
  + Discuss a timeline for completion. Each of you have busy lives, so discuss schedules in order to try and avoid overwhelming someone with work during a period of time, or to plan ahead if someone is going to be gone at some point.
  + How will all group members work collaboratively on this project through the course of the project? Will you share ideas using Google Docs? Will you create a GitHub repository? Some other way? Please explain.
  + Who will be assigned to submit the different components of the group project into Canvas?
  + What will be your group’s policy, if any, on covering for one another if need be (for example, say someone is sick, or has a family emergency)?
  + What policy will you have in place to resolve any intragroup conflict that may arise (for example, if a group member neglects to carry out their delegated duties to post their results on time, or if a group member is not receiving or responding to group updates as often as expected in item 2 above)?
Here are a few options for consideration: warning to the offender, reduction of points, zero credit for the repeat offender, etc.
You may use the instructor as a higher court of appeals – but you will be first expected to document that you implemented your initial conflict resolution plans per your contract and to update the instructor on the outcomes of your own attempts to resolve the conflict.

Note, some of this will likely end up in your One-number Story and your Introduction in the final group report. Do yourself a favor and be thorough now.
