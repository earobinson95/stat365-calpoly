## Wednesday, April 5th

Today we will...

-   Designing a study
-   Writing a protocol
-   Importance of reproducibility
-   Introduce final technical report project

# Study Design

## Class Data Collection

Please write down your answers to the two questions on the peice of paper you have been given.

::: callout-warning
You will be asked to submit your answers to a Canvas quiz after class, so please hold onto or take a picture of your answers!

## `r fontawesome::fa("brain")` Posing Reserach Question

1.  Identify the observational units and variables.

### What is the statistical (research) question being investigated?

2.  Is this an observational study or a randomized experiment? Explain.

3.  In collecting these data, did we make use of random sampling, random assignment, both, or neither?

4.  What is the primary purpose of the type of randomness that was used in collecting these data?

5.  If analysis of the data reveals that the difference between the two groups is "statistically significant," would you have reason to conclude that one treatment caused smaller/larger responses on the task? Explain.

6.  To what population would you feel comfortable generalizing the results of this study? Explain.

## Observational Units and Variables

For each of the following questions, identify the relevant observational units and variables.

::: callout-note
Also classify each variable as numerical or categorical (also binary?). For studies with more than one variable, also identify the explanatory and response variables.
:::

-   What is the average amount of a transaction at the Subway restaurant on campus?

-   Are Reese's Pieces candies equally likely to be orange, brown, or yellow?

-   Can the price at which a grandfather clock sells at auction be predicted from its age, number of bidders, and country of manufacture?

## `r fontawesome::fa("brain")` Statistical Terminology -- "Random"

-   On a scale of 0 -- 10, how important do you consider the word "random" in statistics?

-   What do you think "random" means in everyday usage? How about in slang usage?

-   In what ways is "random" used in statistics?

-   Would you say that the everyday usage of "random" is a help or a hindrance when trying to communicate statistical uses of the word? Explain.

## Scope of Inference

### Experiment vs Observation

```

<!-- **Experiments** involve *randomly assigning* participants and manipulating variables. Results establish causation. -->

<!-- **Observational Studies** involve watching or recording without manipulation. Results generate hypotheses and identify patterns (association). -->

### Generalization to a Population

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

```

<!-- + Random sampling selects a subset from a population where each member has an equal chance of being chosen. -->

<!-- + Random sampling enables us to generalize study results to the population, assuming a representative sample. -->

<!-- + Random sampling reduces bias and increases the accuracy of results by representing the population. -->

# Research Protocols

## Recipes: Chocolate Chip Cookies[^1]

[^1]: https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies/77c14e03-d8b0-4844-846d-f19304f61c57

::: panel-tabset
### Ingredients

::: columns
::: column
-   2 1/4 cups Gold Medal™ all-purpose flour
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1 cup butter, softened
-   3/4 cup granulated sugar
-   3/4 cup packed brown sugar
:::

::: column
-   1 egg
-   1 teaspoon vanilla
-   2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
-   1 cup coarsely chopped nuts, if desired
:::
:::

### Instructions

1.  Heat oven.
2.  Mix ingredients together.
3.  Place dough on a pan.
4.  Bake in oven and let cool.
5.  Store cookies.

#### `r fontawesome::fa("brain")` Brainstorm!

`r fontawesome::fa("question")` Do you feel confident in your skills to make amazing chocolate chip cookies?

`r fontawesome::fa("question")` What questions do you have about how to successfully bake the cookies?

### Detailed Instructions

1.  Heat oven to 375°F. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
2.  In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.
3.  Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
4.  Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.
5.  Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.

## What is a Research Protocol?

The research protocol is a document that outlines the study plan and includes:

-   Background information
-   Rationale for the study
-   Objective(s) of the study
-   Study design
-   Methodology used
-   Statistical considerations

It should be designed to provide a satisfactory answer to the research question.

::: callout-note
The protocol in effect is the cookbook for conducting your study
:::

## Why is a research protocol important?

A research protocol is important because it:

-   It helps to ensure that the study is conducted safely and efficiently.
-   It helps to ensure that the study is conducted ethically and with the highest standards of scientific rigor.
-   The protocol serves as a binding document for the study, outlining what can and cannot be studied.
-   It is typically developed with input from multiple experts in the field to ensure all aspects of the study are covered.

## Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and Human Subjects [^2]

-   The IRB ensures that research involving human subjects meets federal, state, and institutional regulations.
-   The research protocol is the most critical document in your application with your IRB.
-   It is the responsibility of the researcher to obtain informed consent from study participants and maintain confidentiality throughout the study.

## Research Proposal vs Research Protocol

| Research Proposal                                                                                                                                                                  | Research Protocol                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| A [research proposal](https://www.enago.com/academy/six-tips-to-writing-a-research-proposal/) is written to persuade the grant committee, university department, instructors, etc. | A research protocol is written to detail a study's execution plan to meet specified ethical norms for participating subjects. |
| Research proposals are submitted to funding bodies                                                                                                                                 | Research protocols are submitted to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) within universities and research centers.              |

## Research protocol components[^3]

-   Put the methodology in context
-   Materials and tools

## Reproduciblility!

Reproducibility in scientific research is important in order for other researchers to be able to replicate your study results. This includes:

-   A detailed Research Protocol
-   Organized and clear documentation of the study
    -   Data storage
    -   Analyses
    -   Results
    -   Documents
