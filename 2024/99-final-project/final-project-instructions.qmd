::: callout-note
You can choose to use whichever document editors (Word, Google Docs, Quarto) and statistical software programs (R, SAS, Python, JMP, Minitab) you are most comfortable using as long as they can appropriately carry out your analysis. However, you must submit all documents as .pdf file extensions so I can provide written feedback within Canvas via my iPad.

If you have the background and skills, I do encourage you to use a scripting language (R, SAS, Python), and good graphing tools (ggplot2, Tableau, Datawrapper). I will expect more than the default graphics produced by JMP.

## Collaboration Tools

Part of this experience will be learning to communicate and write with others. You may find the following tools useful for setting up your collaboration.

+ GitHub
+ Posit Cloud -- *I think if you get a student subscription for $5/month I can add you to my instructor workspace and you may have collaborative editting privlages (like Google docs for R!). We will need to test this out though*
+ Google Docs
+ OneDrive

# Reproducibe Workflow {.unnumbered}

As a part of this project, you will demonstrate reproducible workflows and research. Following the guidelines in [Third Time's a Charm: A Tripartite Approach for Teaching Project Organization to Students](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/26939169.2022.2118644?needAccess=true&role=button), your root project folder should include:

-   `README.txt` file to orient someone to the electronic files or for processes that will be repeated throughout a study (e.g., specific data cleaning rules and scoring algorithm at multiple time points). Ideally the root project folder will be stored on a secure server and/or cloud location (such as Git repository or OneDrive) that meets all project regulatory needs with access limited to approved team members while allowing for version control.

and the following sub-folders

-   `data` stores all data sets associated with the project (including original, analytic data sets, format files, etc.). The data folder should have a sub-folder where an original, raw, uneditable version of the data is archived and used for import into statistical software (similar to data and data_raw approach in R packages, Wickham, Bryan, and Barrett2022). Projects with many different data sources can have a separate sub-folder for each source

-   `documents` stores all of the written documents for the project. There may be sub-folders for references (statistical and/or domain), article or conference submissions, primary literature/scoring manuals for psychometric scales and other constructs, etc. Importantly, you must document decisions and revised analytic plans during the course of the project.

-   `results` stores all output from the scripts and any derived tables and figures. Spreadsheets, Word tables, RTF files, plots, figures, PDFs of output, all are stored in this folder. If statistical scripts directly produced it or it was created from results derived from statistical scripts, the files should go in this folder.

-   `scripts` stores all statistical programs/syntax/scripts/code (called "scripts" hereafter) used for the project (and statistical scripts should be used as much as possible when handling data!). Much of the documentation of our work is included in statistical scripts tailored to each individual project. Script file names should explicitly describe what step in the research process the script is for and what the script is intended to do, from reading in the original data to creating the analytic data set to summary statistics to multi-variable modeling. RMarkdownfiles / Quarto files (except for your technical report document(s) if using this document editor for your formal writing) should be stored here as well (Baumeret al 2014; Dvoraketal 2019; Allaireetal 2022).

-   Always use good programming practice, which includes: informative script headers, readable code, use of comments,and creation of separate scripts for distinct parts of the project. See CwD ch. 8 about documenting your code.

-   If you are using a non-scripted language (JMP, Minitab, etc.) please make sure to include a document which describes the steps you took in analyzing the data.

In your final submission, you will turn in a `.zip` file of your project folder in order for me to evaluate your organization and workflow.

# CP 1: Data Proposal {#data-proposal -}

You will be working in groups of three to four to produce a technical written report investigating and telling a story about a data set selected from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository. Throughout the course, you will work with this data set to complete individual mini-projects (One Number Story and Data Narrative Visualization) before coming together to storyboard and write your final group report.

::: callout-warning
I will be using the [Childcare Costs](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-05-09/readme.md) data set as an example throughout the quarter. Therefore, you may not select this data set.
:::

For the first group project check point:

1. Select a **data set** from the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository that interests all group members.
  + Include the link to the data repo.
  + Save this data for you to use throughout the quarter.
2. Include a well-written **data description** (recall the 5 Ws!)
  + Where did the data come from (not just TidyTuesday)?
    + When were the data collected?
    + Where were the data collected?
    + How were the data collected?
  + Who/What are the observations/subjects in the data?
  + What information was measured/collected on the observations in the data set?
    + Don't just list these out, make it flow.
3. Include a list of 3 **research questions** you could investigate with your data set along with proposed statistical methods. 
  + Be clear by indicating the variables you would use.
4. Answer the following questions as part of your **group contract.**
  + How will you communicate? Email? Text? Discord? Meet in person or via Zoom?
  + How often will you be expected to check for updates from your group members?
  + Will there be a group leader, or will this task be rotated in some way? How will you ensure that all project deadlines are met?
  + Discuss a timeline for completion. Each of you have busy lives, so discuss schedules in order to try and avoid overwhelming someone with work during a period of time, or to plan ahead if someone is going to be gone at some point.
  + How will all group members work collaboratively on this project through the course of the project? Will you share ideas using Google Docs? Will you create a GitHub repository? Some other way? Please explain.
  + Who will be assigned to submit the different components of the group project into Canvas?
  + What will be your group’s policy, if any, on covering for one another if need be (for example, say someone is sick, or has a family emergency)?
  + What policy will you have in place to resolve any intragroup conflict that may arise (for example, if a group member neglects to carry out their delegated duties to post their results on time, or if a group member is not receiving or responding to group updates as often as expected in item 2 above)?
Here are a few options for consideration: warning to the offender, reduction of points, zero credit for the repeat offender, etc.
You may use the instructor as a higher court of appeals – but you will be first expected to document that you implemented your initial conflict resolution plans per your contract and to update the instructor on the outcomes of your own attempts to resolve the conflict.

Note, some of this will likely end up in your One-number Story and your Introduction in the final group report. Do yourself a favor and be thorough now.

# CP 2: Group Storyboard {-}

Before we begin to write a formal technical report, let's parse out the story! Keeping in mind the sections necessary for the final report, use the Exploratory Data Analysis, One Number Stories, and Narrative Data Visualizations to lay out the data, research question(s), and findings. You may find the following tools useful:

+ Zines
+ [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
+ [Trello](https://trello.com)
+ Get creative!

# CP 3: Final Report {-}

*Note: some of this still needs to be updated from last year, but will follow the general structure.*

## Abstract

::: callout-warning
While the abstract is the first thing a reader sees, this will be the last piece we write.
:::

The Abstract/Executive Summary is a brief, non-technical summary of your research project, and should be around 150-250 words in length. Its purpose is to provide an overview of your project and its significance to the reader.

To create a compelling and accurate abstract, you should consider the following guidelines:

-   Write a stand-alone summary of the project that can be understood without reading the full report.
-   Be clear and concise, avoiding technical language and jargon.
-   Discuss the project's objectives, purpose, background, and why it is important.
-   Describe the data and methods used in the project, including who, what, when, where, how, and the sample size.
-   Highlight the key findings and results of the project.
-   Conclude with recommendations or conclusions that relate to the project's objectives.
-   Avoid introducing any new information that is not discussed in the main report.

## 1. Introduction

The introduction section is where you will hook your reader and draw them into your research project.

This section should:

-   Begin with an attention-grabbing opening statement to engage the reader.
-   Provide background information on the topic and describe any existing theories, research or literature that are relevant to the study.
-   State the research question and explain how the study aims to answer it.
-   Highlight the significance of the study by identifying the potential benefits and contributions to the field
-   Provide an overview of the structure of the report, outlining the major sections and their content (tell the reader what you are going to tell them).

## 2. Data and Methods

In the Data and Methods section of your technical report, you will describe the design of your study and the methods used to collect and analyze the data.

Here are some key components to include:

-   A concise overview of your research question and hypothesis
-   Details on the sample size and selection process, including any inclusion/exclusion criteria
-   A description of the data collection methods used, including measurement tools and techniques
-   A description of the variables used and their definitions.
-   An explanation of any data manipulations made before analysis, including any constructed variables.
-   An explanation of how the data were analyzed, including any statistical tests used to determine significance
-   A discussion of any potential flaws or limitations in the study design, including any data that was excluded or removed
-   (Optional) The use of tables or diagrams to help illustrate your experimental design.

Remember to keep supporting or background data not critical to the flow of the main report in appendices and to reference data from other sources so readers can locate it.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Tip: Remember to focus on the When, Where, How, Who, What:

-   When and where did the study take place?
    -   Was there randomness or more of a convenience sample?
-   Who are the subjects under study? ("subjects" don't have to be people)
    -   Any inclusion/exclusion criteria?
-   What procedures were used to select subjects and collect measurements?
-   Exactly how were the outcomes measured, describe any measurement devices, units of measure
-   Describe the treatments
    -   Include copies of any surveys/questions
    -   Include photographic evidence?
-   Describe the randomization
-   What are the outcomes and covariates?
-   What are the potential flaws/limitations?
-   Were any observations removed? (If so, why?)
:::

::: callout-note
Remember to be thorough yet concise!
:::

### Table of Summary Statistics {.unnumbered}

Your Data and Methods section should include a descriptive statistics table to summarize your data. For quantitative response variables, this will typically involve comparing means, medians, and other summary statistics such as standard deviations and five number summaries. For categorical response variables, you will compare proportions, being cautious to interpret proportions and percentages appropriately, especially differences. To do this effectively, I recommend creating a table that presents your results in a clear and concise format.

Here are some key considerations to keep in mind:

-   Use headings and captions to clearly label the table and help the reader understand the content.
-   Keep the table simple and easy to read, avoiding unnecessary detail or clutter.
-   Be sure to provide appropriate units of measure and any relevant notes or explanations.
-   Consider highlighting key results or differences to draw the reader's attention.

Review the lecture slides and podcasts from the *Chicago Guide to Writing About Numbers* (Chapters 6 and 7) for additional guidance and *Show Me the Numbers* by Stephen Few as a supplemental resource

## 3. Results and Discussion

The Results and Discussion section of your technical report is where you will present your findings and explain what they mean in the context of your research question and hypothesis. Keep in mind that you should assume a reasonably educated audience, but avoid technical jargon and use formal language in the active voice ("by Zombies" test). This section should engage the reader's interest and be succinct, so it's important to focus on the flow and readability of your report.

While separating the results and discussion sections is a common practice, you can choose to integrate them together. It's also possible to separate the exploration data analysis from the inferential analysis, but make sure not to be too repetitive. In this section, you should provide a clear and concise overview of your findings and explain their significance in the context of the research question. Make sure to refer back to your hypothesis and discuss whether your findings support or refute it. Finally, be sure to highlight any limitations or potential sources of error in your study.

### Results

The results section is where you present your findings and interpretation of the data you have collected. This section should be well-organized and easy to follow, with clear graphs and tables that effectively illustrate your analysis.

Here are some key components of the results section:

-   Begin with an introduction that provides some context to your output. Then, provide an analysis of your data and mention which package(s) you used. Avoid including every data analysis result, but be sure to make all methods clear.
-   Include high-quality graphs and tables to effectively summarize your results.
-   Interpret your findings using GEE or ADEPT strategies. Summarize your results both technically and in a way that a non-statistician can understand.
-   Discuss what you observe and summarize your findings, including any overall patterns and any exceptions, as well as the strengths and limitations of your data collection and analysis methods.
-   Provide a graph and summary statistics of your response variable across groups. Use a histogram or dot plot for quantitative data (means and SDs), and a bar graph for categorical data (conditional proportions of successes). Create effective, high-quality visuals with value ordering, color use, and correct units of measurement (not too many significant digits).
-   Test for statistical significance by comparing your groups and provide confidence intervals. Ensure that your analysis matches your graphs (e.g., compared two groups on a quantitative response, look at a two-sample t-test). Avoid shocking the reader with surprising analysis results based on what you pointed out in the graphs.

Summarize your statistical significance and the size of the "effect," focusing mainly on the facts. The discussion section will have more interpretation.

### Discussion

The discussion section is where you interpret your findings and summarize what you learned from the analysis about your overall research question. In this section, you can also discuss the strengths and limitations of your study and provide directions for future research.

Here are the key components of the discussion section:

-   Interpret your findings and summarize what you learned from the analysis about your overall research question.
    -   Did the data behave as you expected?
    -   Is the result statistically significant? How large is the effect? Would you consider it practically significant? How are you deciding? (Do you need to bring in any subject-matter knowledge here?)
    -   Use examples or analogies to help clarify your points and make your discussion more accessible to a broader audience.
-   Strengths (don't restate but interpret) of data collection and analysis methods
    -   Can you draw cause-and-effect conclusions?
    -   To what population are you willing to generalize?
    -   How does your study contribute to the existing knowledge base and the larger context?
-   Critically assess any limitations or potential biases and how they impacted the interpretation of your findings.
    -   Note any deficiencies or unexplained data.
    -   Any issues with the analysis methods used?
    -   Any other potential sources of error or biases?
-   Suggest directions for future research and identify areas that require further investigation.

## 4. Conclusion

The conclusion section is the final chance to leave a lasting impression on your readers and drive home the significance of your research. Here are some tips for crafting a strong conclusion:

-   Recap the main points of your study, including any important findings or trends (tell them what you told them)
-   Discuss the scope of your conclusions, and **justify your reasoning**. Can you generalize your results to a larger population? Can you infer causality? Explain why or why not.
-   Consider the practical significance of your results, and explain how you are measuring this. Are the results meaningful in a real-world context?
-   Return to the big picture, and address the research question. Have you answered it? Can you make any recommendations based on your findings?
-   Finally, offer suggestions for future research that could build on your study and address any lingering questions or uncertainties.

## References

The reference section is an essential part of your academic work and should be included following APA citation style. It should contain a list of all the sources you have used, including textbooks, research papers, and statistical software or packages. By including a reference section, you provide your readers with the opportunity to access and verify the information you have used.

## Appendix

An appendix is a supplementary section that provides additional information to support your research.

Your appendix should include:

-   The appendix may include the original research protocol.
-   Additional relevant documentation that provides further insight into your research methodology and analysis.
-   A raw data file, which contains the original data collected during your research.

# Final Submission {.unnumbered}

Your submission should include

1.  Final report (see draft rubric below) as .pdf file
2.  The .zip folder of your project folder demonstrating your reproducible workflow
    -   Documents sub folder contains a version of your report showing track changes in individual pieces -- clearly labeled
    -   Documents sub folder contains a brief discussion of changes made to original pieces of report along the way -- clearly labeled

**Formatting:** Your final report should use

-   12 point font
-   1 inch margins
-   Reasonable font choice
-   Double spaced pdf file
-   If you have references, use APA citations

**Contents:** Your final report should have the sections and related contents as described above.

**Revisions:** You should also be submitting your discussion of the changes you made and any annotated previous versions within the document subfolder of the .zip file

# Final Report Rubric

*Note: will be updated shortly*

To meet the requirements for the contract, this project must:

-   be turned in on time,

-   include all components described above

-   Meet quality guidelines laid out in the following rubric. In order to meet "satisfactory" for your contracted grade:

    -   A must receive all 3's (or above) on the main components, and demonstration of all additional writing/project components

    -   A- must receive all 3s (or above) on the main components with at most one 2, and demonstration of all additional writing/project components.

    -   B+ must receive all 3s (or above) on the main components with at most three 2s, and demonstration of all additional writing/project components.

    -   B must receive all 2s (or above), and demonstration of all additional writing/project components.

    -   B- must receive all 2s (or above) with a most one 1, and demonstration of all additional writing/project components.

    -   C+ must receive all 2s (or above) with a most three 1s, and missing demonstration for at most 4 additional writing/project components.

    -   C must receive all 1s (or above), and missing demonstration for at most 4 additional writing/project components.

    -   C- must receive all 1s (or above) with at most one 0, and missing demonstration for at most 4 additional writing/project components.

    -   D+ is the *maximum* grade you might obtain from no final submission. In this case grade evaluation will be determined by your previously submitted drafts and other course work.

This means that if you are aiming for an A, complete three booster activities, miss no more than 3 assignments, meet "satisfactory" on your mini-projects, but receive all 2s on your final technical report, you will get a B in the course. Similarly, if you complete one booster activity, miss no more than 3 assignments, meet "satisfactory" on your mini-projects, and receive all 3's on your final technical report, you will get a B+ in the course.

Any deviation to these guidelines will be to your benefit.
